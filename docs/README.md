# MCP Server Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Role-Specific Context MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server. This documentation is designed to provide detailed explanations of all features, components, and APIs of the MCP Server, with a focus on making the information accessible to readers with limited prior knowledge of MCPs.

## What is an MCP Server?

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a specialized application that manages the context and behavior of AI language models. It serves as an intermediary between client applications and AI models (like OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini), handling important tasks such as:

1. **Context Management**: Controlling what information is provided to the AI model
2. **Behavior Configuration**: Defining how the AI should respond in different scenarios
3. **Memory Storage**: Maintaining information across multiple interactions
4. **Query Processing**: Transforming user queries into context-rich prompts for the AI model

The Role-Specific Context MCP Server extends these capabilities by introducing specialized AI roles, persistent memory, and real-time context switching, creating a powerful platform for building sophisticated AI applications.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the MCP Server:

### Core Features

- [Role System](./role-system.md): The foundation of the MCP Server, enabling specialized AI personas
- [Memory System](./memory-system.md): Persistent context storage for maintaining information across conversations
- [Context Switching](./context-switching.md): Dynamic adaptation of AI behavior based on user queries
- [Streaming Responses](./streaming-responses.md): Real-time delivery of AI-generated content as it's being created
- [API Reference](./api-reference.md): Comprehensive documentation of all API endpoints

### Getting Started

- [Installation](../README.md#installation): Setting up the MCP Server
- [Configuration](../README.md#configuration): Configuring the server for your needs
- [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start): Getting up and running quickly

### Advanced Topics

- [Custom Role Creation](./role-system.md#creating-effective-roles): Best practices for designing effective AI roles
- [Memory Management](./memory-system.md#memory-management): Strategies for effective memory utilization
- [Trigger Design](./context-switching.md#creating-effective-triggers): Creating powerful context triggers

## Key Concepts

### Roles

Roles are specialized AI personas with defined expertise domains, communication styles, and behavior guidelines. Each role encapsulates a unique combination of instructions, tone, and system prompts that shape how the AI responds to queries.

### Memories

Memories provide persistent context for AI roles, allowing them to maintain information across conversations. The memory system supports different types of memories (conversations, facts, preferences) with varying importance levels.

### Triggers

Triggers enable real-time context switching based on patterns detected in user queries. They can perform various actions such as switching roles, adding context, modifying tone, or updating instructions.

### API

The MCP Server provides a comprehensive RESTful API for managing roles, memories, triggers, and processing queries. This API allows client applications to interact with all aspects of the system.

## Use Cases

The MCP Server is designed to support a wide range of AI applications, including:

- **Virtual Assistants**: Create assistants with specialized expertise domains
- **Customer Support**: Build support systems that adapt to different query types
- **Educational Platforms**: Develop tutoring systems with subject-specific knowledge
- **Content Creation**: Design assistants for various content creation tasks
- **Multi-Expert Systems**: Implement systems with multiple specialized AI experts
